# Fix Netlify CI Pipeline - Metro Conversion Issue

**Based on:** GitHub Issue #24 - Fix Netlify CI build after Metro conversion - webpack commands obsolete

## Problem Summary
After converting from Webpack to Metro bundler, Netlify CI deployment fails because build commands still reference webpack-specific Expo commands (`expo export:web`) instead of Metro-compatible commands (`expo export`).

## Critical Understanding Gained

**‚ö†Ô∏è WORKING CI EXISTED BEFORE** - The project had successful Netlify deployments via GitHub Actions that worked prior to removing Webpack. The issue is NOT about restructuring the app, but about updating CI configuration to work with Metro instead of Webpack.

**üîç Root Cause Analysis (from GitHub Issue #24):**
- **Error**: `expo export:web can only be used with Webpack. Use expo export for other bundlers.`
- **Failing Command**: `npm run build:web` 
- **Context**: This suggests there was a root-level package.json with a `build:web` script that called `expo export:web`

**üìã Current CI Architecture Analysis Required:**
1. **GitHub Action Workflow** (`.github/workflows/netlify.yml`):
   - Expects `npm run build` at root level (line 26)
   - Publishes from `./dist` directory (line 33) 
   - Was working before Metro conversion
2. **Netlify Configuration** (`netlify.toml`):
   - References `npm run build:web`
   - Publishes from `apps/web/web-build`
   - May be disconnected from actual working setup

## Investigation Strategy

**üî¨ PHASE 1: Understand Current State (NO CODE CHANGES)**
- Analyze existing GitHub Action workflow to understand working setup
- Investigate missing root package.json (likely deleted during Metro conversion)  
- Determine exact build commands and directory structure that worked before
- Identify the disconnect between GitHub Actions and netlify.toml

**üìù PHASE 2: Minimal Configuration Fix (EXPLICIT PERMISSION REQUIRED)**
- Only update CI configuration files (netlify.toml, potentially restore root package.json)
- Change webpack commands (`expo export:web`) to Metro commands (`expo export`)
- Do NOT modify app structure, workspace configuration, or core build processes
- Seek explicit permission before any change that could affect app functionality

## Relevant Files for Investigation

**CI Configuration (SAFE TO INVESTIGATE):**
- `.github/workflows/netlify.yml` - Working GitHub Action workflow
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify deployment configuration  
- `packages/*/package.json` - Workspace package files
- Git history around Metro conversion - to understand what was removed

**Application Files (‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRE PERMISSION TO MODIFY):**
- Root `package.json` - May need restoration with Metro commands
- `apps/web/package.json` - Current build script (currently `expo export:web`)
- Environment files - Only if CI specifically requires changes

## Constraints & Principles

**‚úÖ SAFE ACTIONS:**
- Reading and analyzing existing files
- Understanding current architecture  
- Investigating git history
- Documenting findings

**‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES EXPLICIT PERMISSION:**
- Modifying any package.json file
- Changing build scripts or commands
- Altering directory structure or workspace configuration
- Any change that could affect local development or app functionality

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN:**
- Restructuring the application
- Changing the monorepo/workspace architecture
- Modifying core build processes beyond webpack‚ÜíMetro command changes
- Making assumptions about what "should" work without understanding what "did" work

## Tasks

- [x] 2.5 **CRITICAL:** Review all findings and ensure this document contains enough detail for someone with a cleared context window to understand:
  - [x] What CI setup worked before Metro conversion (exact commands, file structure)
  - [x] What is currently broken and why (specific error analysis)
  - [x] What exactly needs to be changed (file-by-file changes required)

**üìã DISCOVERY DOCUMENTATION SECTION:**

## üîç CRITICAL FINDINGS FROM INVESTIGATION

### **1.1 GitHub Actions Workflow Analysis** ‚úÖ
**File:** `.github/workflows/netlify.yml`
**Key Findings:**
- **Trigger:** Pushes and PRs to `main` branch
- **Build Command:** `npm run build` (line 26) - **RUNS AT ROOT LEVEL**
- **Publish Directory:** `./dist` (line 33) - **EXPECTS ROOT-LEVEL DIST**
- **Environment:** Node 18, uses npm ci for install
- **Secrets:** OpenAI API key, Netlify auth token and site ID
- **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** Workflow expects `npm run build` script in ROOT package.json

### **1.2 Netlify Configuration Analysis** ‚úÖ  
**File:** `netlify.toml`
**Key Findings:**
- **Build Command:** `npm run build:web` (line 2) - **DIFFERENT FROM GITHUB ACTIONS**
- **Publish Directory:** `apps/web/web-build` (line 3) - **DIFFERENT FROM GITHUB ACTIONS**
- **Environment:** Node 18, Supabase env vars, OpenAI not referenced
- **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL MISMATCH:** Commands and directories don't match GitHub Actions

### **1.3 Missing Root Package.json** ‚úÖ
**File:** `package.json` (root level)
**Status:** **FILE DOES NOT EXIST** - This is the root cause!
- GitHub Actions expects `npm run build` at root level
- No root package.json means this command fails
- Likely deleted during Metro conversion

### **1.4 Git History Investigation** ‚úÖ
**Key Discovery:** Root `package.json` existed before with these critical scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "mkdir -p apps/web/web-build && echo 'Static build ready - HTML file already exists'",
    "build:expo": "cd apps/web && npx expo export:web",  
    "build:web": "cd apps/web && npx expo export:web"
  }
}
```
**Status:** Root package.json was removed during Metro migration cleanup
**Evidence:** Git history shows it existed in commit 19610d5~10 and earlier

### **1.5 Current Apps/Web Package.json Analysis** ‚úÖ
**File:** `apps/web/package.json`
**Critical Finding:** Line 32 still contains: `"build": "expo export:web"`
**Problem:** This is the webpack command that Metro cannot execute
**Solution Needed:** Change to `"build": "expo export"` for Metro compatibility

### **üö® COMPLETE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
1. **GitHub Actions expects**: `npm run build` at root level ‚Üí publish `./dist`
2. **Netlify.toml expects**: `npm run build:web` at root level ‚Üí publish `apps/web/web-build`  
3. **Missing**: Root `package.json` (deleted during Metro migration)
4. **Broken**: `apps/web/package.json` still uses webpack command `expo export:web`
5. **Metro requires**: Commands must use `expo export` instead of `expo export:web`

### **üö® PRIME DIRECTIVE - NO WEBPACK REINTEGRATION:**
**CRITICAL:** We are NOT going back to Webpack. We are keeping Metro bundler and the current app stack exactly as is. The ONLY goal is to fix CI pipeline configuration to work with Metro.

### **üîß EXACT SOLUTION REQUIRED (METRO-ONLY):**
**Metro-Compatible Commands:**
- ‚ùå OLD (Webpack): `expo export:web` 
- ‚úÖ NEW (Metro): `expo export`

**Minimal CI Fix Strategy:**
1. **Restore root `package.json`** with Metro-compatible build scripts:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "build": "cd apps/web && expo export",
       "build:web": "cd apps/web && expo export"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Update apps/web/package.json** line 32:
   - Change `"build": "expo export:web"` 
   - To `"build": "expo export"`

3. **Align CI configurations:**
   - Keep GitHub Actions using `npm run build` ‚Üí `./dist`
   - Update netlify.toml to match OR update to use consistent commands

**Output Directory Verification Needed:** Confirm Metro `expo export` outputs to correct directory for each CI system.

### **üìã COMPLETE STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION:**

**File Changes Required:**
1. **CREATE** `/package.json` (root level):
   ```json
   {
     "name": "chat-frontier-flora", 
     "private": true,
     "workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"],
     "scripts": {
       "build": "cd apps/web && expo export",
       "build:web": "cd apps/web && expo export"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **EDIT** `apps/web/package.json` line 32:
   - FROM: `"build": "expo export:web"`
   - TO: `"build": "expo export"`

3. **VERIFY/UPDATE** `netlify.toml` configuration alignment

**Testing Verification:**
1. Test Metro build locally: `cd apps/web && expo export`
2. Verify output directory matches CI expectations
3. Test root build script: `npm run build`
4. Create test commit to trigger CI build
