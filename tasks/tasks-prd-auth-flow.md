- Use Supabase Auth for authentication management
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Ensure mobile-responsive design for all forms
- Follow existing component patterns and styling
- Real-time validation should provide immediate feedback without being intrusive
- Submit button states should be clearly distinguishable (enabled/disabled)
- Terms and consent information must be prominent and clear

## NativeWind Implementation Context

**IMPORTANT: NativeWind Design System Approach**

Since writing this tasks file, the project has adopted **NativeWind v4.1+** as the primary styling solution with a comprehensive design system approach. All authentication components should follow these guidelines:

### NativeWind Implementation Strategy
- **Design System First**: Use centralized design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, border radius)
- **Inline Styles with NativeWind**: Prefer NativeWind utility classes over StyleSheet.create
- **Component Compatibility**: All components must maintain React Native and React Native Web compatibility
- **Responsive Design**: Use NativeWind responsive utilities for mobile-first design
- **Accessibility**: Maintain comprehensive ARIA labels and accessibility features

### Key Implementation Details
1. **Design Tokens**: Centralized color palette, spacing scale, typography system, and border radius values
2. **Component Architecture**: Use design system constants with NativeWind classes for consistent styling
3. **Cross-Platform**: Ensure components work seamlessly on web, iOS, and Android
4. **Performance**: NativeWind provides 25-33% performance improvements over traditional styling
5. **Migration Path**: Components can be incrementally converted from StyleSheet to NativeWind

### Current NativeWind Status
- ✅ **NativeWind Infrastructure**: Fully configured and operational
- ✅ **Design System**: Comprehensive design tokens implemented
- ✅ **Component Conversion**: 7/7 core components successfully converted (SignUpForm, LoginForm, PasswordValidation, ChatPage, AuthFlow, Checkbox, FormInput)
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete implementation guides and compatibility documentation
- ✅ **Testing**: All E2E tests passing with NativeWind components

### Authentication Component Requirements
All authentication components (LoginForm, SignUpForm, PasswordValidation, etc.) should:
- Use the established design system constants
- Implement NativeWind utility classes for styling
- Maintain existing functionality and accessibility features
- Follow the documented NativeWind compatibility patterns
- Use hybrid approach when React Native styles alone cannot achieve desired web behavior

### Reference Documentation
- `docs/NATIVEWIND_COMPATIBILITY.md` - Comprehensive compatibility guide
- `docs/NATIVEWIND_COMPONENT_AUDIT.md` - Component conversion strategy
- `docs/NATIVEWIND_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete implementation details
