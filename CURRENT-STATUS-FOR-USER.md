# CURRENT WORK STATUS - GUARANTEED VISIBLE TO USER

## CONFIRMED WORKING IN SAME CODEBASE
- ‚úÖ Same directory: /Users/geoffreydudgeon/Documents/Cursor Projects/chat-frontier-flora  
- ‚úÖ Same branch: fix/nativewind-css-pipeline-investigation
- ‚úÖ Source code changes ARE persisted (Message.tsx shows removed markdown import)

## PHASE 1 WORK COMPLETED ‚úÖ
1. **Fixed missing react-native-markdown-display** - Replaced with Text component
2. **Simplified streaming simulation** - Removed setTimeout/setInterval complexity  
3. **Fixed import paths** - Corrected ../../../utils/validation ‚Üí ../../utils/validation
4. **Fixed entry point** - package.json "main": "index.ts" (was "test-entry.ts")

## PHASE 1 TESTING RESULTS ‚ö†Ô∏è
- ‚úÖ Metro starts successfully
- ‚úÖ Metro serves HTML correctly (curl http://localhost:8081 works)
- ‚ùå JavaScript bundle compilation STILL HANGS
- ‚ùå Puppeteer navigation times out (30s)
- ‚ùå Bundle requests return empty/timeout

## CURRENT ISSUE üö®
**Metro serves HTML but bundle compilation hangs - Phase 1 fixes resolved some issues but additional blocking dependencies remain.**

## NEXT STEPS
1. Investigate remaining missing dependencies or complex import chains
2. Consider testing with even more minimal component tree
3. May need to identify specific dependency causing the hang
