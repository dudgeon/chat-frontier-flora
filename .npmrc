# тЪая╕П  CRITICAL: NPM Configuration for Monorepo + React Native Web
# ЁЯЪи DO NOT REMOVE legacy-peer-deps=true ЁЯЪи
#
# This setting is required for:
# 1. React Native Web peer dependency resolution
# 2. Monorepo workspace compatibility  
# 3. NativeWind v4 + React 18.2.0 compatibility
#
# Without this setting:
# - npm install will fail with peer dependency conflicts
# - React Native Web may not resolve correctly
# - Expo + Metro + NativeWind stack may break
#
# BEFORE MODIFYING: Test npm install in clean environment
