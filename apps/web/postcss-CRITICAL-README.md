# CRITICAL: PostCSS Configuration Issue

## Problem Discovered
During Metro NativeWind v4 migration, we found that `postcss.config.js` was causing compilation failures:

```
Error: Loading PostCSS "autoprefixer" plugin failed: Cannot find module 'autoprefixer'
```

## Root Cause
- The PostCSS config requires `autoprefixer` but it's not installed
- NativeWind v4 with Metro plugin already handles CSS processing via `withNativeWind()`
- Having both configurations creates conflicts

## Current Solution
- **postcss.config.js disabled** (renamed to postcss.config.js.disabled-for-testing)
- **NativeWind v4 Metro plugin handles all CSS processing**
- **Real App.tsx compiles successfully in 873ms**

## Future Options
1. **RECOMMENDED**: Keep PostCSS config disabled since NativeWind v4 handles everything
2. **Alternative**: Install autoprefixer if PostCSS config is needed for other purposes
3. **Investigation needed**: Determine if autoprefixer provides benefits not covered by NativeWind

## Files Affected
- `postcss.config.js` → `postcss.config.js.disabled-for-testing`
- `postcss.config.js.disabled` (existing backup)

## Test Results
- ✅ Metro compilation: 873ms with PostCSS disabled
- ❌ Metro compilation: Failed with PostCSS enabled (missing autoprefixer)
- ✅ NativeWind classes processing: Working via Metro plugin
- ✅ Tailwind CSS: Processed correctly by NativeWind v4

**DO NOT re-enable PostCSS config without resolving autoprefixer dependency first.**
