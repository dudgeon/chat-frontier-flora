I dug through the repo you just sent ( chat-frontier-flora-main (3).zip ) and traced every step in the style-generation pipeline—Metro, Webpack, Babel, PostCSS/Tailwind, and NativeWind itself.

Two separate problems in the Webpack + Babel setup are working together to make the styles look “hit-or-miss” on the **web** target:

|
**What’s happening**

 |

**Why it breaks styling**

 |

**Where I found it**

 |
| --- | --- | --- |
|

**1.  NativeWind’s Babel plugin is loaded as a preset instead of a plugin.**  js\\npresets: \[\\n  \[\\"babel-preset-expo\\", { jsxImportSource: \\"nativewind\\" }\],\\n  \\"nativewind/babel\\"   //  ← should live in \`plugins\`, not here\\n\],\\nplugins: \[\\"react-native-reanimated/plugin\\"\]\\n

 |

Babel never runs the NativeWind transform.  React-Native-Web therefore receives a <View> with a **className** prop, but no inline style prop.  Only the classes that _happen_ to be in your compiled CSS have any effect—hence the “sometimes styled, sometimes not” behavior.

 |

babel.config.js in both the repo root and apps/web/

 |
|

**2.  The Tailwind CSS generated by PostCSS only recompiles when src/index.css changes, not when you add a new class in a .tsx component.**  Your custom Webpack patch injects postcss-loader in the CSS rule, so Tailwind does run once. But Webpack’s file-watcher doesn’t notice new classes in TS/TSX files, so the next hot-reload shows blank bubbles for any _new_ utilities.

 |

In dev you’ll see: ① classes that existed at first build work, ② newly-added utilities are missing until you fully restart expo start --web, and ③ CI builds _look_ fine because they compile from scratch.

### **The shortest route to a stable fix**

1.  **Put NativeWind where Babel expects it and keep Reanimated last.** In both babel.config.js files:

```
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: [
      'nativewind/babel',               // ① run the transform
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin'  // ② must remain last
    ],
  };
};
```

2.  **Let NativeWind (not Webpack) own Tailwind on web.**

    Replace your manual postcss-loader surgery with NativeWind’s helper:

```
// apps/web/webpack.config.js
const createExpoWebpackConfigAsync = require('@expo/webpack-config');
const { withNativewind } = require('nativewind/webpack');

module.exports = async function (env, argv) {
  const config = await createExpoWebpackConfigAsync(env, argv);
  return withNativewind(config);        // ← one-liner does the loader + watch wiring
};
```

3.  **Import the default stylesheet once so resets/utilities are there:**

```
// apps/web/index.ts
import 'nativewind/tailwind.css';        // before `registerRootComponent`
```

4.  (Optional) **Delete the hand-rolled src/index.css** now that NativeWind/Tailwind will JIT-compile every class it sees across the monorepo on each rebuild.

### **Why this cures the “inconsistent” symptom**

-   **Single source of truth.**  Only one pipeline (NativeWind) is responsible for turning className="bg-green-500 p-4" into real CSS—both for mobile (inline style) and web (generated stylesheet + className).
-   **Fast refresh picks up new utilities.**  The withNativewind helper wires a Tailwind watcher into Webpack’s HMR graph, so editing .tsx files triggers an on-the-fly CSS rebuild instead of requiring a full server restart.
-   **No double-compilation surprises.**  Removing the bespoke PostCSS hack eliminates a second, harder-to-debug path that sometimes raced ahead (or got skipped) during CI and Netlify builds.

Give those changes a try—after a fresh pnpm install && expo start --web you should see every NativeWind utility render correctly on first refresh, with no more “unstyled” components sneaking through.
