# Cursor Rules for chat-frontier-flora

## CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW - NEVER VIOLATE
**MANDATORY PROTOCOL: NO EXCEPTIONS**

1. **Local Testing First**: All changes MUST be tested locally with full verification
2. **PR for Preview Deploy**: Create PR to trigger preview deployment - NEVER merge without this step
3. **Preview Testing**: Test changes on the preview URL thoroughly
4. **CI Verification**: Ensure all CI checks pass on the preview
5. **Only Then Merge**: Merge to main only after preview testing confirms everything works
6. **Production Verification**: Test production deployment after merge

**VIOLATION OF THIS WORKFLOW IS A CRITICAL FAILURE**

If the AI attempts to merge to main without preview testing, it must:
- STOP immediately
- Acknowledge the workflow violation
- Create PR for preview testing instead
- Wait for explicit user approval after preview testing

## Authentication and Testing Rules

- Always run from apps/web directory for Expo commands
- Use data-testid selectors for E2E tests, not input[name] selectors
- Verify webpack compilation shows "compiled with 1 warning" not "1 error"
- Test both localhost and production environments appropriately
- Never claim success without evidence (curl responses, test results, user confirmation)

## Cost Management

- Use Sonnet for routine tasks
- Only use Opus for complex architectural decisions
- Make minimal changes - don't touch unrelated files
- Stop immediately if the AI starts making unrelated changes
- Document expensive mistakes to prevent repetition
