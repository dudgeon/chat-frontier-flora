# Escalation Procedures for Regression Detection

## Overview
This document outlines the escalation procedures to follow when regressions are detected during the Gluestack UI pilot implementation. These procedures ensure rapid response and minimize impact on project stability.

## Regression Detection Triggers

### üö® IMMEDIATE ESCALATION (Level 1)
**Stop all work immediately and escalate**

1. **Build Failures**
   - Webpack compilation errors ("compiled with 1 error")
   - TypeScript compilation failures
   - Metro bundling failures
   - Any process that prevents the application from starting

2. **Critical Functionality Broken**
   - Authentication flow completely broken (cannot signup/login)
   - Application crashes on startup
   - White screen of death
   - Complete loss of navigation

3. **Test Suite Failures**
   - Unit test failures > 5% of baseline
   - E2E test failures > 2 tests
   - Any test that was previously passing now fails

### ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT ESCALATION (Level 2)
**Complete current sub-task, then escalate before proceeding**

1. **Visual Regressions**
   - Layout completely broken on any viewport
   - Components not rendering at all
   - Critical UI elements missing (buttons, forms, navigation)

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Bundle size increase > 20%
   - Load time increase > 50%
   - Memory usage increase > 30%

3. **Accessibility Regressions**
   - New accessibility violations with "serious" or "critical" impact
   - Existing accessibility passes decreased by > 10%

### üìã STANDARD ESCALATION (Level 3)
**Document and escalate at next checkpoint**

1. **Minor Visual Issues**
   - Styling inconsistencies
   - Color variations
   - Minor spacing issues

2. **Minor Performance Issues**
   - Bundle size increase 10-20%
   - Load time increase 25-50%

## Escalation Actions

### Level 1: IMMEDIATE ESCALATION

1. **STOP ALL WORK**
   - Do not proceed with any further changes
   - Do not attempt to fix the issue without approval

2. **IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK**
   ```bash
   # Git rollback (preferred)
   node scripts/rollback-procedures.js git

   # Emergency rollback if git fails
   node scripts/rollback-procedures.js emergency
   ```

3. **VERIFY ROLLBACK**
   ```bash
   node scripts/rollback-procedures.js verify
   ```

4. **DOCUMENT THE ISSUE**
   - Create detailed issue report (see template below)
   - Include exact error messages
   - Include steps to reproduce
   - Include screenshots/logs

5. **NOTIFY USER IMMEDIATELY**
   - Report the regression
   - Provide rollback status
   - Request guidance on how to proceed

### Level 2: URGENT ESCALATION

1. **COMPLETE CURRENT SUB-TASK**
   - Finish the current component/change
   - Do not start new components

2. **DOCUMENT THE REGRESSION**
   - Create detailed regression report
   - Include comparison with baseline
   - Include impact assessment

3. **PREPARE ROLLBACK OPTIONS**
   - Identify which components need rollback
   - Prepare component-level rollback if needed

4. **ESCALATE TO USER**
   - Report the regression with full details
   - Provide rollback options
   - Request decision on how to proceed

### Level 3: STANDARD ESCALATION

1. **DOCUMENT THE ISSUE**
   - Add to regression tracking log
   - Include severity assessment
   - Include proposed solutions

2. **CONTINUE TO NEXT CHECKPOINT**
   - Complete current task section
   - Escalate at next mandatory checkpoint

3. **PROVIDE OPTIONS**
   - Present issue with potential solutions
   - Include cost/benefit analysis of fixes vs rollback

```

## Communication Protocol

### Immediate Notification (Level 1)
```
üö® CRITICAL REGRESSION DETECTED

Component: [Component Name]
Issue: [Brief description]
Status: Work stopped, rollback initiated
Action Required: Immediate guidance needed

Details: [Link to full report]
```

### Urgent Notification (Level 2)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT REGRESSION DETECTED

Component: [Component Name]
Issue: [Brief description]
Impact: [Impact description]
Status: Current task completing, awaiting guidance

Options:
1. Rollback affected component
2. Continue with fixes
3. Full rollback

Details: [Link to full report]
```

### Standard Notification (Level 3)
```
üìã REGRESSION NOTED

Component: [Component Name]
Issue: [Brief description]
Severity: Minor
Status: Documented, continuing to checkpoint

Will escalate at next checkpoint with options.
```

## Decision Matrix

| Regression Type | Severity | Action | Timeline |
|----------------|----------|---------|----------|
| Build Failure | Critical | Immediate Rollback | < 5 minutes |
| Auth Broken | Critical | Immediate Rollback | < 5 minutes |
| App Crash | Critical | Immediate Rollback | < 5 minutes |
| Visual Broken | High | Complete task, then escalate | < 30 minutes |
| Performance | Medium | Document, escalate at checkpoint | Next checkpoint |
| Minor Styling | Low | Document, continue | Next checkpoint |

## Rollback Decision Tree

```
Regression Detected
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Critical (Level 1)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Immediate Rollback
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Verify Rollback
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Escalate Immediately
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Urgent (Level 2)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Complete Current Task
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Assess Rollback Options
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Escalate for Decision
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Standard (Level 3)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Document Issue
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Continue to Checkpoint
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Escalate at Checkpoint
```

## Success Criteria for Continuing

After any regression and rollback:

1. **All tests passing** (unit + E2E)
2. **Application starts without errors**
3. **Authentication flow works end-to-end**
4. **No console errors**
5. **Visual comparison shows no critical regressions**
6. **Performance within acceptable thresholds**

## Contact Information

- **Primary**: User approval required for all Level 1 and Level 2 escalations
- **Documentation**: All issues logged in `regression-log.md`
- **Rollback Logs**: Available in `rollback-log.txt`

**Remember**: When in doubt, escalate. It's better to pause and get guidance than to compound regressions.
