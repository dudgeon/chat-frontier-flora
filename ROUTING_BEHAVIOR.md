# Routing Behavior Documentation

## Correct Routing Behavior

### Routes
- **`/` (root)** - Homepage with login/signup functionality
- **`/chat`** - Protected chat page for authenticated users
- **No other routes planned** (no `/dashboard`, `/auth`, `/profile`, `/home`)

### User Flow
1. **Unauthenticated users:**
   - Visit any route → Redirect to `/` (root homepage)
   - See login/signup forms on homepage
   - Can register or login from homepage

2. **Authenticated users:**
   - Visit `/` (root) → Redirect to `/chat`
   - Visit `/chat` → Access chat functionality
   - Visit other future routes → Access those routes (no redirect)
   - Can logout from any authenticated page

## ✅ Current Status

### Routing Implementation: FIXED ✅
- **AppRouter.tsx** - Updated to correct routing behavior
- **Routes properly defined** - `/` for homepage, `/chat` for authenticated users
- **Redirects working** - Unauthenticated users redirect to `/`, authenticated users redirect from `/` to `/chat`

### ChatPage Implementation: EXISTS ✅
- **ChatPage component** - Fully built with profile menu and logout functionality
- **Shows "Chat Feature Coming Soon!"** - Placeholder content but functional
- **Authentication integration** - Displays user email and has logout button

## ❌ Critical Issue Discovered: INCOMPLETE AUTHENTICATION FLOW

### Root Cause of Test Failures
The Playwright tests are failing because **the authentication flow itself is incomplete**, not because of routing issues.

### Missing Authentication Components (from tasks-prd-auth-flow.md):
1. **SignUpForm Missing Critical Fields:**
   - ❌ Age verification (18+) checkbox
   - ❌ Enhanced data usage consent text
   - ❌ Real-time password validation display
   - ❌ Using `displayName` instead of required `full_name`
   - ❌ Missing `development_consent` field

2. **Missing Components:**
   - ❌ PasswordValidation component
   - ❌ useFormValidation hook
   - ❌ Tooltip component

3. **Completion Status:**
   - ✅ Database Schema: 100% complete
   - ✅ Authentication State Management: 100% complete
   - ❌ Sign-Up Flow: Only 40% complete
   - ❌ All other task groups: 0% complete

### Why Tests Fail
1. **Registration fails** - Form missing required database fields
2. **Users can't authenticate** - Incomplete form prevents successful account creation
3. **No redirect to /chat** - Because authentication never succeeds
4. **Tests timeout** - Waiting for redirects that never happen

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Complete SignUpForm** - Add missing age verification and full_name fields
2. **Implement PasswordValidation component** - Real-time password rule display
3. **Fix form validation** - Ensure all required fields are captured
4. **Test authentication flow** - Verify users can actually register and login

### Test Expectations (Currently Correct)
The tests expect:
- **Registration success** → Redirect to `/chat` ✅
- **Login success** → Redirect to `/chat` ✅
- **Protected route access** → Redirect to `/` (for unauth) or allow access (for auth) ✅
- **Root access when authenticated** → Redirect to `/chat` ✅
- **Logout** → Redirect to `/` ✅

The test expectations are correct - the issue is that authentication never succeeds due to incomplete forms.
