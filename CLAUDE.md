## Git workflow for Claude Code

1. **Always work on a feature branch**
   If none exists:
   `git checkout -B fix/<topic>`

2. **Commit every tangible step** (≤ 20 min or one major checklist item)
   Prefix in-progress commits with `WIP:`.
   Example: `git commit -m "WIP: fix validation import path"`

3. **Push after each commit**
   `git push -u origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)`
   If first push on this branch, open a **draft PR**: "🚧 WIP \<topic\>".

4. **Update the task log** (e.g. `NATIVEWIND_V4_METRO_MIGRATION_TASKS.md`)
   in the *same commit* whenever progress changes.

5. **Before merging**
    Squash/rebase WIP commits into clear logical commits; never force-push to `main`.


## Project Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
- **Yarn Workspaces** with `apps/*` and `packages/*`
- **apps/web**: Expo web app using React Native for Web
- **apps/mobile**: Expo mobile app with React Navigation
- **packages/shared**: Shared types, API client, utilities
- **packages/ui**: Shared UI components
- Code sharing via workspace references (`workspace:*`)

### Authentication System Architecture
- **Context-based state**: `AuthContext` provides global authentication state
- **Supabase Auth integration** with session persistence and automatic token refresh
- **Role-based access control**: Primary/Child user hierarchy enforced by database RLS policies
- **Protected routing**: Route guards with automatic redirection
- **Edge Functions fallback**: Authentication can work with Edge Functions or client-side only

**Critical Authentication Files:**
- `apps/web/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Core authentication logic and state management
- `apps/web/src/components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx` - User registration with complex validation
- `supabase/migrations/20240325_create_user_profiles.sql` - Database schema for user profiles

### Chat System Architecture
- **Component composition**: `ChatInterface` → `MessageList` + `MessageComposer` + `ChatHistoryPane`
- **Mock streaming**: Character-by-character message rendering simulation
- **Cross-platform components**: React Native components working on both web and mobile
- **Prepared for real-time**: Architecture ready for Supabase real-time subscriptions

### Technology Stack Integration
- **Expo 50.x** for universal React Native development
- **NativeWind 4.1+** for Tailwind CSS in React Native (strict compatibility required)
- **Supabase** for authentication, database, and real-time features
- **React 18.2.0** (exact version required for React Native Web compatibility)
- **TypeScript** throughout with strict configuration

### Testing Architecture
- **Stagehand-based E2E tests**: All active tests written using Stagehand AI (natural language browser automation)
- **Playwright test runner**: Executes Stagehand tests across multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile)
- **Archived traditional Playwright tests**: Located in `e2e/archived/` and `e2e/quarantined-playwright-tests/` - ignore these
- **Current active tests**: All in `e2e/stagehand-*.spec.ts` files using AI-powered interactions
- **3-phase test structure**: Core (must pass) → Secondary (warnings) → Cleanup (never fails)
- **Environment-aware testing**: Dynamic test behavior based on localhost/preview/production

## Critical Development Rules

### Environment Management
- **Root `.env` file**: Contains all environment variables, automatically copied to `apps/web/.env`
- **Prefixed variables**: All Expo variables must use `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix
- **Environment verification**: Always run `npm run status:check` when debugging issues

### React Version Requirements
- **Exact React 18.2.0** required for React Native Web compatibility
- **No version ranges** allowed in package.json (use exact versions)
- **Legacy peer deps**: `.npmrc` must contain `legacy-peer-deps=true` for monorepo resolution

### NativeWind Compatibility
- **NativeWind 4.1+** strict compatibility requirements
- **Cross-platform styling**: Use NativeWind classes that work on both web and mobile
- **Theme integration**: Custom theme defined in `tailwind.config.js`

### Authentication Development
- **Never modify auth files** without reading `docs/AUTHENTICATION_FLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md` first
- **RLS policies**: Database-level security enforced in Supabase
- **Session management**: Automatic token refresh handled by Supabase client
- **Testing**: Login tests require special handling due to "Remember me" checkbox behavior

### Testing Guidelines
- **All tests are Stagehand-based**: Write tests using natural language AI actions, not traditional Playwright syntax
- **Ignore archived tests**: Traditional Playwright tests in `e2e/archived/` and `e2e/quarantined-playwright-tests/` are obsolete
- **Active test files**: Only work with `e2e/stagehand-*.spec.ts` files
- **E2E test protection**: See `docs/LOGIN_TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for implementation details
- **Environment isolation**: Test data isolated from production via environment-specific stores
- **False failure prevention**: 3-phase architecture prevents unreliable test failures

### Deployment Requirements
- **Build verification**: Always test builds locally before pushing
- **React version consistency**: Ensure exact React versions across all packages
- **Environment variables**: Verify all required env vars are set for target environment
- **Preview testing**: Never merge to main without preview deployment testing

## Development Workflow

1. **Start work**: Run `npm run status:check` to verify environment
2. **Environment setup**: Ensure `.env` exists in project root with required variables
3. **Development**: Use `npm run dev:safe` to start with environment verification
4. **Testing**: Run `npm run test:safe` for comprehensive E2E testing
5. **Pre-commit**: Verify builds work locally and tests pass
6. **Deployment**: Test on preview deployment before merging to main

## ⚠️  CRITICAL: Version Upgrade Protocol

**🚨 NEVER UPGRADE DEPENDENCIES WITHOUT FOLLOWING THIS PROTOCOL 🚨**

This project uses a highly version-sensitive stack (React 18.2.0 + NativeWind v4 + Metro). ANY version changes can break the app.

### Before ANY Dependency Upgrade:

1. **Read VERSION_COMPATIBILITY.md** - Complete compatibility matrix and known breaking combinations
2. **Create test branch**: `git checkout -b test-upgrade-[package]`
3. **Baseline test**: `npm run test:safe && node test-blue-user-bubble.js`
4. **Upgrade and test**: 
   ```bash
   npm install [package]@[version]
   npm run web  # Test Metro compilation
   node test-blue-user-bubble.js  # Test NativeWind styling
   ```
5. **Verify critical features**:
   - Metro compiles without errors
   - NativeWind generates CSS classes (not just css-view-*)
   - Blue user bubbles appear correctly
   - Authentication flow works

### Emergency Rollback:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1 && npm install
```

### Ultra-Critical Versions (DO NOT CHANGE):
- React: `18.2.0` (exact)
- React-DOM: `18.2.0` (exact)
- NativeWind: `^4.1.23` (v4 only)
- Expo: `~50.0.0`

## Important File Locations

### Configuration Files
- `.env` - Root environment variables (copied to apps/web/.env)
- `netlify.toml` - Deployment and edge function configuration
- `playwright.config.ts` - E2E testing configuration
- `tailwind.config.js` - NativeWind styling configuration

### Authentication System
- `apps/web/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Core auth logic
- `apps/web/src/components/auth/` - Auth forms and validation
- `supabase/migrations/` - Database schema and RLS policies

### Chat System
- `apps/web/src/components/chat/` - Chat interface components
- `apps/web/src/components/ChatPage.tsx` - Main chat page layout

### Testing
- `e2e/stagehand-*.spec.ts` - Active Stagehand-based E2E tests (AI-powered)
- `e2e/archived/` and `e2e/quarantined-playwright-tests/` - Obsolete traditional Playwright tests (ignore)
- `playwright.config.ts` - Test runner configuration
- `docs/LOGIN_TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Critical testing documentation

Never create files unless absolutely necessary. Always prefer editing existing files. The authentication system was complex to implement correctly - handle auth-related changes with extreme care.

## Development Memories & Recommendations

- Whenever you change the version of any component in this application, perform research to ensure it doesn't break other components, especially Nativewind which is very version sensitive
- Test assumptions about html rendering with the puppeteer mcp before drawing conclusions or making decisions
- **Stagehand Test Credentials**: there are valid test credentials located in `/Users/geoffreydudgeon/Documents/Cursor Projects/chat-frontier-flora/.env.stagehand`
